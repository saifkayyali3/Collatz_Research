# The $qn+r$ Research Lab

## Mathematical Analysis and High-Precision Deep Searching
This repository serves as the Engine Room for the [Collatz Multiverse](https://github.com/saifkayyali3/Collatz_Multiverse) and [Collatz Standard](https://github.com/saifkayyali3/CollatzStandard) projects. While the main applications focus on visualization, this lab is dedicated to stress-testing conjectures, identifying loops, and mapping the limits of numerical stability.

---

## Included Tool: *[Deep Search Python Engine](Deep-Search.py):*

A high-performance terminal tool designed for massive integers that:

* Utilizes Python's arbitrary-precision integers with a 1,000,000 digit string limit.
* Utilizes Cycle Detection by implementing a hashed `seen` set for loop detection.
* Uses Safety Guards for *Automatic* divergence detection to prevent exponential memory consumption.

## Research Documentation:
#### Core Findings are in the [Research File](RESEARCH.md)
### Key Discoveries:
* The Precision Cliff: Why standard floating-point math fails for numbers ($10^{67}$)
* $3n-1$ Mirroring: Proof of the symmetry between $3n-1$ (positive) and $3n+1$ (negative)
* Shared Trajectories: The discovery of "Mathematical Highways" in the $4n+8$ system where all paths od negative numbers eventually merge at the commencement 1.
